# lib-interop
This repository contains several types of files.
## Schemas
This is the most important folder, containing the official schemas for the interoperability specifications. Right now there are two schemas, one for the Dialog Events specification and one for the Conversational Envelope Specification.
## Docs
In the "requirements" folder, there is a PowerPoint containing images illustrating concepts in the Dialog Events specification.
##Examples
Contains a start on a Jupyter Notebook illustrating a websocket server. This is very rudimentary at this point.
##Javascript
A library of Javascript functions for processing Dialog Events, an example Juypter Notebook and some examples of JSON-formatted Dialog Events.
##Python
Parallel folders to the Javascript folders, except the functions are Python. The Python folder is more complete than the Javascript one.
